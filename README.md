# OSM Geofabrik Universal QML Style
A universal QML style set for OSM Geofabrik Shapefile extracts for use in QGIS

The current version is still far from beeing finished, but will be updated regulary.

# What it is
This is a style set for QGIS in .qml format for osm extracts in shapefile format from http://download.geofabrik.de/.

# Requirements
QGIS 3.4 or later is required to run this set as intended. When using older versions some styles might not work as intended.

# How to use / install
Download the repository and create your QGIS Project in the main folder, or just use ExampleProject.qgs.
Add your OSM data downloaded from http://download.geofabrik.de/ as .shp.zip format and unpack it to Geofabrikdata folder.
Now add the .qml files via right-clicking on each layer -> properties -> style -> load style (Not necessary when using ExampleProject.qgs).
Of course you can also use another folder structure. To keep symbols just open the .qml files with a texteditor and replace all paths.
Suggested layerorder:

# Background and intention
I often need vector maps based on osm data. As ive done a new map (and style) everytime I started a new project I decided to create a style I can use for all places in the world in all scales. A criteria is, that no data shall be modified neither new layers created. Goal is to just download data, add styles and done.
Of course achiving this goal is a giant task.
**So feel free to help and improve this project. Modify, adapt, improve and re-share!**

# Credits
Symbols are mainly taken from here https://www.mapbox.com/maki-icons/, some are self made.
Also I got some inspiration (besides from OSM itself) from these two projects: https://github.com/yannos/Beautiful_OSM_in_QGIS and https://github.com/charleyglynn/OSM-Shapefile-QGIS-stylesheets. So I used e.g. the same scale ranges or similar stylings for buildings/shadows.
